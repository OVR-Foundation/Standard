# Example Disclosure Entry

This is an example of how a security disclosure could be published and verified under the OVR model, including an optional SBOM reference.

```yaml
id: "openvuln:example.com:firefox-2025-0001"
title: "Firefox allows access to saved passwords without master password"
description: >
  A vulnerability in Firefox's password manager allows local attackers
  to extract stored credentials if no master password is set.


technical_details: >
  The internal storage for saved passwords is not encrypted by default.
  If a user does not manually configure a master password, saved credentials
  are accessible through the local profile storage without needing authentication.
  An attacker with local filesystem access can retrieve the file
  `logins.json` and decrypt stored data using known static keys.
