The OVR (Open Vulnerability Report) Proof of Concept defines a minimal open standard for reporting vulnerabilities in a decentralized, verifiable, and trustworthy way.

## Overview

This standard draft describes a basic format for creating vulnerability records that can be verified independently by cryptographic signatures and are linked to a verifiable identity.

OVR records are designed to be lightweight, easy to understand, and compatible with existing tools and standards like SBOMs.

## Example Record

> [!NOTE]
This is a simple example and definitely not finished.

```yaml
id: "openvuln:example.com:firefox-2025-0001"
title: "Firefox allows access to saved passwords without master password"
description: >
  A vulnerability in Firefox's password manager allows local attackers
  to extract stored credentials if no master password is set.


technical_details: >
  The internal storage for saved passwords is not encrypted by default.
  If a user does not manually configure a master password, saved credentials
  are accessible through the local profile storage without needing authentication.
  An attacker with local filesystem access can retrieve the file
  `logins.json` and decrypt stored data using known static keys.
