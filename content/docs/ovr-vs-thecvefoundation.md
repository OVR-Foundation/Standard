# Introduction

Both the **CVE Foundation** and the **OVR Foundation** are responses to a critical global challenge: how the world should identify, coordinate, and disclose software vulnerabilities.

But while they share some surface similarities, their **goals, structures, and visions for the future** are fundamentally different.


## üîç Quick Overview

| Aspect              | **CVE Foundation**                                         | **OVR Foundation**                                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Main Goal**       | Sustain and govern the existing CVE ecosystem              | Build a **new, global open standard** for vulnerability tracking |
| **Scope**           | Vulnerability ID issuance, funding, governance of CVE      | Standard development, metadata, disclosure policy, tooling       |
| **CVE Dependency**  | Fully tied to and compatible with CVE                      | **Independent of CVE** ‚Äì not just a technical layer              |
| **Governance**      | Centralized board and CNA network                          | **Federated**, consensus-based, community-transparent            |
| **Funding Base**    | U.S. government contracts & donations                      | International, public-interest based (memberships & grants)      |
| **Motivation**      | Ensure continuity after CVE nearly lost U.S. funding       | Build a **neutral, resilient** global alternative                |


## Different Philosophies

### CVE Foundation

The CVE Foundation was established in 2025 after the U.S. CVE Program faced a near-shutdown due to funding issues. Its primary mission is to **preserve the CVE ecosystem**, diversify its funding, and maintain MITRE‚Äôs infrastructure, which still handles the CVE database.

It works closely with CNAs (CVE Numbering Authorities), CISA, and global institutions such as ENISA (EU VDP) to **coordinate vulnerability ID issuance**.

### OVR Foundation

The OVR Foundation emerged from a deeper concern: the **structural fragility of centralized, nation-controlled security infrastructure**. It aims to create an **open, globally governed, and legally neutral framework** for managing software vulnerability information‚Äîcovering not just IDs, but also:

- Disclosure timelines
- Metadata formats (e.g. SPDX, SBOM, OSV integration)
- Legal interoperability
- Distributed trust and dispute resolution

Rather than extending or rescuing the CVE model, OVR seeks to define **what should come next.**


## Global Trust vs. Legacy Infrastructure

| Topic                   | **CVE Foundation**                                      | **OVR Foundation**                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**               | Operational continuity                                  | Long-term independence & legitimacy                                |
| **Trust Model**         | U.S.-based, MITRE-originated infrastructure             | Based on cross-organizational consensus and open participation                        |
| **Technical Vision**    | CVE IDs, JSON schemas, web APIs                         | Federated registries, multi-format mapping, verifiable metadata    |
| **Role of Governments** | Strong role for U.S. agencies                           | Equal footing for governments, NGOs, companies, researchers        |

## Complementary ‚Äì But Not the Same

The OVR Foundation doesn't aim to compete with the CVE Foundation. Instead, it **reimagines what a modern, resilient, and globally trusted vulnerability registry should look like**‚Äîespecially in an era where trust and neutrality are critical.

If you're working in open source, national security, compliance, or vulnerability research, and you're seeking **a more globally inclusive alternative** to CVE-style registries, OVR welcomes you to join the conversation.
