## Introduction
The OVR Foundation is committed to building a strong, open, and community-driven ecosystem for vulnerability coordination and standard development.

We believe that transparency, collaboration, and decentralization are essential for a sustainable and trustworthy infrastructure.



## Guiding Principles

- **Open Participation**  
  Anyone is welcome to contribute ideas, feedback, and improvements.

- **Transparency**  
  All decision-making processes, drafts, and proposals are publicly visible.

- **Neutrality**  
  OVR aims to remain independent and not favor any specific company, government, or organization.

- **Decentralization**  
  We encourage multiple authorities, verifiers, and contributors to prevent central points of failure.

- **Community First**  
  The needs of the broader security community drive our priorities and initiatives.



## Governance Model

- **Working Groups**  
  Specialized groups can form around specific topics such as Specification Development, SBOM Integration, Identity and Verification, and Outreach.

- **Proposals (OVR-Ps)**  
  Major changes to standards, governance, or infrastructure are made through community proposals (similar to RFCs or PEPs).  
  These proposals will be discussed openly and require community feedback before adoption.

- **Consensus-Based Decisions**  
  We aim for rough consensus and broad agreement, not strict majority voting.

- **Stewardship Committee**  
  A small group of trusted contributors will oversee critical administrative tasks.  
  Their role is limited, transparent, and subject to regular review by the community.



## How to Get Involved

- **Join our [Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#ovr-foundation:nope.chat)**  
  Participate in discussions, working groups, and help shape the direction of OVR.

- **Follow Our Updates**  
  Watch our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ovr-foundation) for drafts, proposals, and tooling.

- **Propose Improvements**  
  Submit your ideas, drafts, or questions via Matrix or GitHub Issues.

- **Spread the Word**  
  Help us grow the community by sharing OVR with others who care about open security standards.



## Next Steps

We are currently working on:

- The first full draft of the OVR Specification
- Early governance process documents
- A Code of Conduct for all community spaces
- Outreach to partners and similar initiatives

We welcome feedback and contributions at every stage.



> **Note**: As the project is still in its early stages, governance processes may evolve over time based on community needs and real-world experience.
