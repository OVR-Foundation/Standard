## Introduction

All substantial changes to the OVR Specification or its governance structure must go through a formal proposal process.



## What is an OVR-P?

An **OVR-P** (Open Vulnerability Report Proposal) is a structured document describing a suggested change, enhancement, or policy.

Each OVR-P should:

- Clearly define the change
- Justify its necessity
- Discuss alternatives
- Include implementation or adoption considerations


## Current Proposal Workflow
Coming soon:

1. **Idea Submission**  
   Propose your idea in [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ovr-foundation:nope.chat) or via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ovr-foundation/standard/discussions).

2. **Draft the Proposal**  
   Use the provided Markdown template and submit it as a pull request to the `ovr-foundation/standard` repository.

3. **Community Feedback**  
   Proposals are discussed openly in Matrix and GitHub.

4. **Rough Consensus**  
   Once reviewed and agreed upon, a proposal is accepted and documented.


## Proposal Format

A proposal should follow the [OVR-P template](https://github.com/ovr-foundation/standard/blob/main/proposals/ovrp-0000-template.md) and be stored in the `proposals/` directory of the repository.

- Fork the repository:  
  [`github.com/ovr-foundation/standard`](https://github.com/ovr-foundation/standard)
