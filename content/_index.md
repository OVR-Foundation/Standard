<br>

The **OVR Foundation** is building a decentralized standard for vulnerability coordination — inspired by the CVE system but designed for a federated, resilient, and community-governed future.

We aim to:
- Enable decentralized vulnerability reporting using verifiable IDs
- Support self-hosted and federated infrastructure
- Integrate with SBOMs and legal compliance frameworks
- Encourage global participation via open specifications

> ✨ We believe coordination should be **transparent**, **resilient**, and **owned by the community** — not controlled by a single entity.



## 🔍 What is OVR?

The **Open Vulnerability Report (OVR)** standard provides a new way to document and publish software vulnerabilities using:
- Decentralized identifiers (OVR-IDs)
- DNS-based authority verification
- IPFS or Ceramic for resilient data storage
- Cryptographic integrity (signatures)
